# Vim As IDE

The goal is to have an up-to-date set of instructions for turning Vim / Neovim into an IDE for every language. Is Vim meant to be an IDE? No. However, there are certain instances, especially on larger projects, where IDE-like features are pleasurable. This repo is to aid in those moments. By and large, these setups are overkill for basic text editing, which is the core proposition of Vim.
