# Vim As IDE

The goal is to have an up-to-date set of instructions for turning Vim / Neovim into an IDE for every language. This leads to the question: what is an IDE in Vim? The main features that standout to me are: linting, completion and additional components of that language's toolchain.

### Completed

- [x] [R :: Neovim](https://github.com/beigebrucewayne/Vim-IDE-4-All/blob/master/R-neovim.md)

### TODO

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Julia
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Haskell
